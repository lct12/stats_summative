Final Paper for Applied Analytical Statistics at Oxford: The Non-Monetary Negative Externalities of Airbnb

## Abstract
Recently, many researchers have examined the impact of short-term rentals such as Airbnb on local residents, finding that a greater increase in Airbnb supply often results in higher property and rental prices, although the effect may vary. However, nobody has yet performed a quantitative examination of non-monetary externalities, to my knowledge. I thus used a two-stage instrumental variables strategy to quantify the impact of Airbnb, as proxied by number of listings or bookings in a small geographic area, on non-monetary externalities, specifically noise, parking, and mice or insect infestations, as proxied by 311 complaints, in that same area. I used the implementation or enforcement of new local short-term rental laws, which caused a drop in supply of both Airbnb listings and bookings, as an instrument. I found that areas with a higher proportion of hosts with more than one listing or listings that rent out entire apartments as opposed to individual rooms see an increase in 311 complaints, but the overall impact of all Airbnb units on 311 complaints was mixed. These results may help policymakers further refine their regulation of Airbnb to decrease the impact of negative externalities.

## Description of Contents
`Summative.pdf` is my entire paper.
There are two scripts that I used:
1. `Summative.ipynb` is the name of the Jupyter Notebook that I used for most of the project -- downloading the data, processing it, creating graphs, etc.
2. `regressions.R` is the name of the R file that I used to run regressions, since R is much better suited for regressions than Python is.
